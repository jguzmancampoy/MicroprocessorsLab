# Microprocessors
The project program is stored in the LCD_Hello_World branch.
The 4x4, DAC_Setup and LCD files contain setup code and subroutines called in Simple1 (which contains the main game loop).
An executable was written in order for the song (included in the LCD branch) to launch via media player before build. The executable is not included as the commands are specific to the college computer file structure, it is stored in the H drive because the C drive gets wiped out overnight.
