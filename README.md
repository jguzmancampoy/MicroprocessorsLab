# Microprocessors
This repository contains code supporting the 3d year Microprocessors Laboratory product development cycle.

The 4x4.asm, DAC_Setup.asm, UART.asm and LCD.asm files contain setup code and subroutines for plotting, displaying messages on the LCD screen and more. They are called in Simple1.asm, which is the file containing the main game loop.

An executable was written in order for the song (included in the LCD branch) to be launched before build via the Windows Media Player. The executable is not included as the commands are specific to the college computer file structure.

A video of our demonstration is also included.
